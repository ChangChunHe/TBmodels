.. title:: Overview


TBmodels is a Python package for evaluating tight-binding models. It features methods for reading and writing tight-binding models to various formats, and evaluating the Hamiltonian and eigenvalues of the system. It is considerably faster than comparable packages, enabling it to handle first-principles derived tight-binding models. 

If you use TBmodels for your research, please consider citing it as [D. Gresch and A. Soluyanov, *"The TBmodels package: Speed and memory improvements in evaluating tight-binding models"* (in preparation)].
